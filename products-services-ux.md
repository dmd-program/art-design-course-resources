# Product, service, UI/UX

This category could include real-world commercial projects, speculative design, or more in-depth research projects. 

To participate in a real-world project, you will need to locate a client — a company, event, organization, group, etc. — that has a specific challenge. You can then work with the client to design a solution that meets a need or opportunity. Whether you are working with web and information technology, or 3D printing physical prototypes, many aspects of the design process will be similar.

Depending on the deliverable, you may want to explore related media pages for technical and process tips. 

## Types of product or service projects

* Functional mobile or web app
* High fidelity interactive mockups \(UI\)

* Comprehensive user experience \(UX\) research 
* Instructional design product
* Digital fabrication products or prototypes \(handheld objects, furniture, wearables, clothes, toys, etc.\)

  * Branding
    * Your project may or may not include high-fidelity designs; focusing on simple wireframes, user analysis, and functionality can be sufficient for a UX project. But if you are going to develop aesthetic visual designs, you might consider the brand's core values and messaging at this stage alongside your product's functional design.

Still a ton of work to program anything complex. Stick to something simple if you're new to this.

3. Testing and analysis
   * User testing
    * Conduct a survey online
    * Get your friends to test your prototype 
    * Use *specific* and structured questions to get useful feedback. 
   * Performance testing
   * Accessibility evaluation
   * Heuristic evalution: comparing your design to industry benchmarks for usability. The [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) from the Neilson Norman group are commonly used. 

4. Iterate 
    * Keep refining and testing ad infinitum! 
    * Your project might never advance beyond low-fidelity prototypes, and that could be fine! 
    * High-fidelity designs should usually only be made *after* a low-fidelity prototype. One option for limited time is to create high-fidelity \(fully-designed\) designs for only a limited number screens or sections, to depict the UI without a comprehensive high-fidelity prototype. 

### Proof of concept

The goal of a proof is to demonstrate that you have a strong grasp of relevant research, design, fabrication, and/or development principles.
* For a product or service, a low or high fidelity mockup would demonstrate the essential functionality of your idea. 
* For a research project, you could collect some test data and compose a brief presentation of your research, or demonstrate your plan to collect primary data and outline any testing or visualization strategies.
