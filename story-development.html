<h2 id="1-exploration">1. Exploration</h2>
<p>Make a list of films, shows, books, comics, or other narrative media that you love &#x2014; things that might be neighbors to your own work in genre or tone. What are the visual aesthetics of these? The central character motivations? The genre conventions or tropes? </p>
<p>What can you bring to the story that&apos;s uniquely yours? Informed by your own experiences, passions, or knowledge? </p>
<p>How can you turn things on their head? If you have a story idea, what is something totally unexpected or problematic that could occur? </p>
<p>Generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude can be very helpful at this stage. Consider using chatbots to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask you provocative questions after sharing your initial ideas or influences.</li>
<li>Generate story pitches or summaries based on your vague ideas &#x2014; see what sounds cool and what doesn&apos;t. </li>
<li>Help with research into locations, technology, cultures, etc. </li>
<li>Provide feedback on your writing or ideas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-outline">2. Outline</h2>
<p>As you collect inspiration and ideas, begin to form an outline of the overall story and/or individual character arcs. There are many approaches to writing a story, but I think the strongest ones start at the character level rather than the overall &quot;plot.&quot; </p>
<p>For each character, make a table like the one below to flesh them out and discover driving forces or problems that might inform the overall story.</p>
<ul>
<li>Character Name:</li>
<li>Physical appearance: </li>
<li>Personality: </li>
<li>Biography/Backstory: </li>
<li>What do they want? (\ surface motive, what they tell themselves)</li>
<li>What do they need? (\ true motive, may be unconscious)</li>
<li>What&apos;s their problem? (if there&apos;s no problem in their life, the story is over before it begins)</li>
<li>What do they value above all else?</li>
<li>Beginning state: (how they are at the <em>beginning</em> of the story arc)</li>
<li>End state: (how they are at the <em>end</em> of the story arc)</li>
</ul>
<p>To outline the overarching story, approach it from the <strong>act</strong> and <strong>scene</strong> levels. The overarching story should have a &quot;beginning state&quot; and an &quot;end state,&quot; with characters and events progressing and changing along the way. Traditionally, each act and scene should also have such an &quot;arc&quot;, with a turning point, or moment, when a character says or does something pivotal.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Act 1:<ul>
<li>Beginning state:</li>
<li>Turning point:</li>
<li>End state:</li>
<li>Scenes<ul>
<li>Scene 1:<ul>
<li>Beginning state:</li>
<li>Turning point:</li>
<li>End state:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scene 2: <ul>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Act 2:<ul>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Shorter stories might only have a single &quot;act&quot;, and there are other shapes and structures to discover (see <em>Meander, Sprial, Explode</em> above), but this is a reliable format used in many films and books. Pay attention to the next movie you watch and see if you can detect the &quot;turning point&quot; of a given scene. What are the &quot;beginning&quot; and &quot;end&quot; states for the protagonist?</p>
<p>Some writers might outline the story to a lesser (or greater!) extent, but following this format will let you get feedback as you go. If you just start hammering it out on a blank piece of paper one chapter at a time, big picture questions may not be addressed until it&apos;s too late. Within the compressed time of a class project, you may not fully develop your story, but you can bring it into focus enough to assess the major themes and craftwork.  </p>
<h2 id="3-write">3. Write</h2>
<p>Google Docs and Word are both great. Sharing a cloud document is usually best for receiving feedback from your instructor. </p>
<p>There are more industry-specific screenwriting apps too, that can help with accurate formatting. Such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>Scrivner  </li>
<li>Final Draft</li>
<li>Writer Duet</li>
<li>FadeIn</li>
</ul>
<p>For comics, storyboards, and animatics, writing a script is still useful because its faster than drawing pictures. You can describe the visuals within the script like this:</p>
<p>SARAH: &quot;No, don&apos;t go in there!&quot;</p>
<p><em>JASON walks down the steps into the basement and sees a giant creature writhing in the shadows</em></p>
<p>JASON: &quot;What the&#x2014;&quot; </p>
<h2 id="4-edit">4. Edit</h2>
<p>As you share your work-in-progress, using comments, annotations, and history-tracking is very helpful.</p>
<p>You will also surly want to go back to early scenes and edit them as you develop later pieces of the story. </p>
