Are you beginning a brand design project? This page will help you get started.

Read this article from UXstudio about [how to conduct brand research](https://uxstudioteam.com/ux-blog/how-to-conduct-brand-research/). If you want more examples and guidance, check out [*Designing Brand Identity*](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/pensu/reader.action?docID=5014629) by Alina Wheeler and Debbie Millman \(access online through PSU Library\).

Then take a look at your own company, product, or whatever you're designing a brand for. Follow the steps below and prepare this information in a blog post or standalone document. If you want to demonstrate your graphic design skills, you can put this info into a PDF made in Illustrator or Figma that feels visually styled and "designed."
