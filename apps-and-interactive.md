# Realtime Interactive

## Types of Realtime Interactive Projects

* Augmented/Virtual Reality \(AR/VR\) games, visualizations, architecture, and journalism. 
* Interactive 2D or 3D fiction or non-fiction story
* 2D or 3D video game, ideally something [creative](https://thegameawards.com/nominees/fresh-indie-game) or [serious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_game)
* Physical game \(printed boards, cards, and/or 3D objects\)
* Projected or screen-based interactive installation art
* Physical computing project \(Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc.\)
* Creative coding projects \(e.g. Processing)
* Apps for mobile devices or desktop. 
   * For designer-friendly app prototypes, see the [UI/UX page](products-services.md).


**Note about realtime interactive projects:** These projects are incredibly engaging and exciting means of communication. Depending on the scope of the project, they can be [produced in a few days on a train](https://trainjam.com/), or they can sometimes take multiple years by a skilled team in a few short months. It is unusual for an interactive project to be quickly created by only one person, as there are many production requirements that take time to produce. If you would like to create a a project like this, consider assembling a team with complimentary skills, or if working solo, choose a style and assets that afford rapid production. You can outsource pre- or post-production tasks and focus on your core production interest.

## Production requirements

1. **Research**

   * Brainstorm ideas and research relevant work or subject matter.
   * Collect inspiration images or clips to show the visual style you're aiming for. 
   * Write a short synopsis of narrative work.
   * [Creating mood boards](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/developing-a-mood-board/welcome?u=76811570)
   * [InVision ](https://www.invisionapp.com/)\(collaborative inspiration board tool\)

2. **Storyboarding or Wireframing**

   Storyboards can still be useful for interactive software or physical installations! Outline the sequence of events in your head. For apps, you would typically produce a simple wireframe using sketched screens or post-its to figure out the how users would navigate your interface.

   
   * [Storyboarding for film and animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQsvhq28sOI)
   * [Storyboard Templates](https://boords.com/storyboard-template)
   * [Storyboarder App](https://wonderunit.com/storyboarder/)

3. **Asset production**

   Prepare images, sounds, 3D models, textures, or other assets you will need for your project.
   * Game assets \(3D models, textures, etc.\)
   * Physical materials or electronic hardware
   * UI elements or designs

      There are many sites that will print custom boards and cards, as well as mail-away 3D printing services. Do some searching and contact your instructor for tips.

   

### Proof of concept

The goal of a proof is to demonstrate that you can operate the necessary software, create needed assets, and show that you have a strong grasp of relevant production principles.

Produce a basic example of a realtime project in your chosen software production pipeline that demonstrates you are capable of manipulating digital assets and code. This should be an exported runtime application compatible with Mac OS or Windows, or video documentation of a functional device.

For physical games or interactive projects, produce a low fidelity prototype.
