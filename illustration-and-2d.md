# Graphic Design, Illustration, Concept Art

Whether creating work to tell your own story, or developing branding to communicate the message of a client, this type of visual design can take many forms. 

For long term projects, ensure that you are producing an appropriate amount of work. So rather than a single logo or poster, you might develop a series of images or variations for diverse use cases.

  * Logo design
  * Stationary or merchandise design

  * Children's book

  Consider how to present your work in a professional distribution package. How can you provide context for your design beyond simply exporting some JPEGs?
   * Project website
   * Printing a physical book
   * Poster prints
   * Formatting for digital devices
   * Digital publication \(PDF\)

   Often brand projects are presented as a [style guide](https://brandingstyleguides.com/) which can be a splashy presentation of the brand assets in action, and/or an authoritative "handbook" documenting all the visual assets that make up the brand's design system. If you're making a PDF or slide deck, you might include:

   * Primary logo
   * Logo variations
    * Simplified logo versions for small scale 
    * Multiple [lockups](https://designtlc.com/what-is-the-difference-between-a-logotype-logomark-and-logo-lockup/) or variations of logo pieces. 
    * Improper variations of the logo to showa client *what not to do.*
   * Color palette
   * Fonts and text styles
   * Decorative icons, patterns, shapes, etc. 
   * Sample product or advertising images, social media posts, etc.
   * Value statements, copywriting, slogans, etc. 


### Proof of concept

A proof of concept should demonstrate drawing skills, ability to use the elements and principles of design, and proficiency with your software of choice. Showing process is important for the proof of concept, consider recording your screen, show ideas written on paper or journal, and your ability to approach a personal or client project critically and with an industry standard process.
