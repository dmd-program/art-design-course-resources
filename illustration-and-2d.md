# 2D Design, 3D Rendering, and Illustration

Whether creating work to tell your own story, or developing branding to communicate the message of a client, this type of visual design can take many forms. 

For long term projects, ensure that you are producing an appropriate amount of work. So rather than a single logo or poster, you might develop a series of images or variations for diverse use cases. 

## Project types

* Branding and/or print design
  * Design system or standards manual
  * Logo design
  * Stationary or merchandise design
* Posters and Infographics
* Typeface design
* Digital illustrations
  * Concept art for pre-production \(character, vehicle, environment design for comics, games, film, etc.\)
  * Sequential comics \(print or web\)
  * Digital children's book \(for iPad or mobile device\)
* Architectural renderings
* Product renderings
* App or website mockups \(see those respective development pages for more\)
* Data visualizations or Infographics
* 2D or 3D assets for games including character design and environment design
* Code-generated art
