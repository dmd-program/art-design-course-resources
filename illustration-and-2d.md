# 2D / 3D design and Illustration

Whether creating work to tell your own story, or developing branding to communicate the message of a client, this type of visual design can take many forms. 

For long term projects, ensure that you are producing an appropriate amount of work. So rather than a single logo or poster, you might develop a series of images or variations for diverse use cases.

  * Design system or standards manual
  * Logo design
  * Stationary or merchandise design

### Proof of concept

A proof of concept should demonstrate drawing skills, ability to use the elements and principles of design, and proficiency with your software of choice. Showing process is important for the proof of concept, consider recording your screen, show ideas written on paper or journal, and your ability to approach a personal or client project critically and with an industry standard process.
